# learning-python
This is my walk through Zed A. Shaw's online course "Learn Python the Hard Way". Coding is absolutely new to me - except for a bit of HTML/CSS. I picked Python more or less radomly. Mostly I'm interessted in coding itself. If you've got any suggestions on further learninig material or resources I'm happy to here from you.
